Description of the project:

In this game, the main purpose of the games is to catch all the pokemons on the world without being turned into a frog by Barbara. All the other players on the map have the ability to catch wild pokemons on his place and challenge the other players. In a fight, the player who kill the other player's pokemon wins and get that pokemon as a reward. The player, after catching pokemon from a place, can summon the pokemon to challenge any player at the same place if that player has any pokemon. Each pokemon has attack, health and a unique skill).
You can press on the new button pokemon around you to update the status of all pokemons around you
Testing:
Here is the list of codes I use for testing in Gack World:
lounge.gain(new Pokemon("MewTwo", 200, 1000,"telekinesis"));
		goodShipOlin.gain(new Pokemon("Legendary Birds",300,800,"raising fire"));
		lounge.gain(new Thing("Karl's glasses"));
		lounge.gain(new Pokemon("Pikachu", 300 ,1000, "destructive thunder"));
		offices.gain(new Pokemon("Charmander", 400,900, "hell fire"));
		offices.gain(new Pokemon("Squirtle", 500,800, "torrent"));
		offices.gain(new Pokemon("Bulbasaur", 400, 800,"photosynthesis"));
		offices.gain(new Pokemon("Eevee", 300,700,"thunderstone")); 

dormitory.gain(new Pokemon("Blastoise", 400,900,"water shooting"));
		dormitory.gain(new Pokemon("Butterfree", 500,900,"compoundeyes"));
		dormitory.gain(new Pokemon("Sandslash", 400, 1000,"sand carpeting"));
		dormitory.gain(new Pokemon("Golbat", 300,900, "ultra sound "));
I do integrated testing by adding numerous pokemons and new auto person objects to see how they interact with each other.
